# e2198_Ca_imaging
Ca imaging data from Briggman et al. (2011).  
The stimulus is a bright bar on a dark background.
"Each of the eight stimuli used was a bar (0.2 mm wide x 1 mm long) moving in one of eight different directions at 0.5 mm/sec."
So the On and Off responses to the bar edges should be 2 seconds apart.
128 ms/frame, 31 frames per stimulus

data/roi_data.mat contains DeltaF/F for all ROIs, and some metadata
